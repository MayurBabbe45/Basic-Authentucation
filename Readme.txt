# Steps to Run My Application

1. Download and extract the code from the repository.

2. Download and install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

4. Install the necessary Node.js modules by running the following command:
          >npm install


5. Update the PostgreSQL credentials in the database configuration file. This file is typically named something like `db.js` or `database.js`, and you'll need to enter your PostgreSQL username, password, database name, and possibly other details.

6. Run the application. You can do this in two ways:

- If you have `nodemon` installed (a utility that automatically restarts your Node.js application whenever file changes in the directory are detected), use the following command:
    ```
    nodemon index.js
    ```
- Alternatively, you can run your application with Node.js directly using the following command:
    ```
    node index.js
    ```

Remember to replace `index.js` with the main file of your application if it's named differently.
